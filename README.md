## Introduction
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a global pandemic respiratory illness since 2019. It ranges from mild to severe symptoms, affecting all aspects of life. Preventive measures include vaccination, masks, and distancing. Research and collaboration are key in managing its spread.

## Problem Aimed to Solve

This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with Python code to extract, clean, and visualize COVID-19 data from various sources. Additionally, the project provides a dashboard to explore the data interactively.

#### 1. Import the data from API using the requests library.

    
#### 2. The imported data was in JSON format hence we used JSON library to read the data.

#### 3. We looked for null values and replaced them with zero, looking for duplicates.
    
#### 4. Stated analyzing the data by using pandas functions like group by, sort_values, etc.
    
#### 5. Used nested 'for' loops to extract the relevant data from the nested dictionary.

#### 6. Extracted the individual state data from the data frame in CSV format and imported data into MySQL.
    
#### 7. Aggregated the distribution by month and week wise for each state.
    
#### 8. Imported the aggregated data into Excel for further Analysis.
